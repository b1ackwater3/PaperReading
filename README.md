>What can LLMs do for KGs? Or, in other words, what role can KG play in the era of LLMs?

🙌 This repository collects papers integrating **knowledge graphs (KGs)** and **RAG** for **large language models (LLMs)**.

😎 Welcome to recommend missing papers through **`Adding Issues`** or **`Pull Requests`**.
